FartBox
=======

An app that farts. Based on the BeatBox app in the Big Nerd Ranch Android Programmming 3rd Edition.
The app looks for any sound assets in a specific directory and then provides a recyclerview of buttons labelled with filenames.
Pressing a button will play that sound (all of which are currently farts). 
Up to five sounds can be played simultaneously, before the app automatically swaps out the oldest.
